## Roadmap:

Have a left-handed mode for guatar.
Auto select the new input device for them (and make it obvious youdid that)

User authentication for high score board (clerk?)

legal@beatfrenzy.io

After auth:
Need a like feature so people can like songs they like.
Only show the highest high score for the particular user
Social media song clip sharing (backend

Backlog:
Piano input device
Allow dragging and dropping or selecting multiple folders at once
Multi-player with multiple instruments
Allow adjusting timing if notes and song doesn't line Up
Cloud sync
Practice mode (slow down songs, loop sections)
Detailed performance graphs
User profiles
Friend leaderboards
Discord integration
Pursue the education angle – Schools and music teachers pay for software. Reach out to a few and gauge interest.
Consider YouTube Shorts/TikTok marketing – Rhythm game clips do well. "Can you beat this score?" challenges.
